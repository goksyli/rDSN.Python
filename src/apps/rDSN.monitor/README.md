#rDSN.monitor

##Overview

**rDSN.monitor** is a test http server based on rDSN.Python. It allows users to easily get control of the whole system and view profiling data on web clients. 

**UPDATED** Now rDSN.Monitor supports both two modes! 
* Standalone Mode: rDSN.Monitor works as a carrier, creating a new thread to load target programs. 
* Embedded Mode: rDSN.Monitor works as a plugin, running as a daemon app inside the target programs. **(RECOMMENDED)** 

##Features

* System overview
* Profiling data visualization
* Online command line interface 
* Remote file editing 
* Service automatic deployment and management //TODO
* Solution wizard for developers //TODO
* Cluster overview  //TODO

##To start

To start rDSN.monitor, you should install rDSN.Python first. Check [here](https://github.com/rDSN-Projects/rDSN.Python/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.

After you properly generated required dlls (dsn.core.dll,dsn.dev.python_helper.dll), please put them under "rDSN.monitor" directory. 

Before the next step, noticing that comparing to rDSN.Python, there are some other python packages needed for hosting the http server. We recommend you to use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install them. Click the link to see the instructions to install pip.

When you finished installing pip, now run:
```bash
cd .\rDSN.monitor
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

##Scenario I: Standalone Mode
This mode is convenient when you're writing new functions for rDSN.Monitor and want to test it. Here we take "simple_kv" as an example.


###Build dynamic link libraries of target program

Build dsn.replication.simple_kv.module in rDSN, then we get dsn.replication.simple_kv.module.dll, put it under rDSN.monitor directory.

###Modify the config file
In config file, this part is about monitor config:
```bash
[apps.monitor]
name = monitor
type = monitor
arguments = 8080
pools = THREAD_POOL_DEFAULT
dmodule = dsn.dev.python_helper
```
The 'arguments' is the port number http server will use. 

For every other app (meta, replica), we should make sure:
```bash
dmodule = dsn.replication.simple_kv.module
```

###Launch target program and http server
Then run command
```bash
cd .\rDSN.monitor
python server.py standalone
```
The Python script will start a thread to run simple_kv and a thread to host the http server.

Now you could visit [here](http://localhost:8080).

##Scenario II: Embedded Mode
Embedded mode is in more common use.

###Modify config file to enable rDSN.Monitor
At the bottom of monitor config:
```bash
[apps.monitor]
name = monitor
type = monitor
arguments = 8080
pools = THREAD_POOL_DEFAULT
dmodule = dsn.dev.python_helper
```
Added the following line:
```bash
dmodule_bridge_arguments = rDSN.Monitor.py
```

###Launch target program
Now you can directly run your target program!

Take "simple_kv" as an example.

```bash
dsn.replication.simple_kv.exe config.ini
```

The target prrogram will automatically startup with rDSN.Monitor on.
